## Changes for Part 3

- The CSS for the `about.html` page was updated to enhance readability and improve section separation. A dividing line was added below section headings, and additional spacing was introduced to create better visual distinction between different sections. The font styling and line spacing were also refined to improve text clarity, making the content easier to read and more structured.
